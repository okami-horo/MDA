# MDA

Maa Doro Assistant

**[简体中文](README.md)** | **English**

</div>

MDA is a game automation assistant built on [MaaFramework](https://github.com/MaaXYZ/MaaFramework), rewritten from [DoroHelper](https://github.com/1204244136/DoroHelper).

## ⚠️ Account Ban Risk

Some users have recently reported that their game accounts were banned after using this software. MDA is a third-party automation assistant, and using it may violate the game's terms of service or risk-control rules.

**Please use this software only after fully understanding and accepting the risks, including account bans and data loss.**

## Member Features

To provide a more stable and efficient automation experience, this project is currently **maintained and updated full-time**. Due to the significant time and effort required for ongoing development, adapting to game updates, and maintaining the project, MDA adopts a **daily runtime quota by membership tier** model to ensure the long-term healthy development of the project.

Details are as follows:

- **All features available**: Free users can use all tasks. Tasks are no longer divided into member-only tasks with the 🍊 marker.
- **Daily runtime quota**: Different membership tiers provide different daily runtime limits. The default free tier is **Orange Free**, with **10 minutes** of runtime per day.
- **Quota reset time**: Daily runtime quota refreshes by tier at **4:00 AM** every day.
- **Sponsorship Method**: When running tasks, the run log displays your current tier, today's remaining quota, and the device binding/subscription link. You can sponsor the project through that link.

Thank you to all contributors for their efforts, and to every user for their understanding and support! Your sponsorship is the biggest motivation for me to continuously optimize MDA.

## Language Compatibility

MDA's interface supports multiple languages including Chinese and English, but **the script's functionality is currently only adapted for the Chinese game interface**.

If you are using an English or other language game interface, you may encounter recognition errors or functional issues. If you experience errors, please switch your game to **Simplified Chinese** first and try again. If the problem persists after switching, feel free to submit feedback and I'll help investigate.

## Getting Started

### 1. First Launch

Take a moment to explore the interface before running any tasks to understand the available features and settings.

### 2. Set Up Hotkeys (Recommended)

Go to **Settings (top-right corner) → Hotkeys** and enable global hotkeys, in case the program becomes unresponsive and you need to exit.

## Reporting Issues

If the script encounters an error, follow these steps to collect information for troubleshooting.

### Step 1: Enable Debug Images

1. Go to **Settings → Debug**
2. Enable **Save Debug Images**

> ⚠️ This option must be re-enabled each time you start the program.

### Step 2: Reproduce the Issue

Debug mode saves a screenshot for every action, so **avoid running tasks for extended periods** — it will generate a large number of images and consume disk space.

Recommended approach:

- After enabling debug mode, **only run the task that has the issue**
- Stop immediately after reproducing the problem and prepare to package the logs

### Step 3: Export the Logs

1. Click the **Export Logs** icon next to **Run Log** in the bottom-right corner
2. In the `debug` folder that opens, find the generated archive
3. Send the archive to the developer

> 💡 After submitting feedback, it's recommended to **delete the old `vision` folder** and restart the program. This keeps debug images from different issues separate and makes troubleshooting easier.
